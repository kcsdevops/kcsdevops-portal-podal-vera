- Consistent spacing and typography
- Mobile-first responsive design

## Business Focus

1. Professional, clean design
2. Accessibility and responsive layout
3. Clear call-to-actions for appointments and sales
4. Trust-building elements (certifications, testimonials)
5. Easy navigation and user experience
